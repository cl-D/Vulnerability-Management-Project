# Vulnerability-Management-Project

## Introduction
In this project we aim to deploy a vulnerable machine using Metasploitable and VMWare Workstation, and then analyze it using OpenVAS, a vulnerability management tool. Metasploitable is an intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine, that is used as target practice for security training. It serves as a perfect playground for vulnerability management and analysis. In order to discover all of the vulnerabilities on the machine, we will use a tool called OpenVAS to perform scans on our system.

## Tools Used
- OpenVAS: A vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management tool.
- Metasploitable 2: An intentionally vulnerable Linux VM.
- Kali Linux: The Linux distro we used to instal OpenVAS.
- VMware Workstation Pro: The hypervisor we used to host the Kali Linux VM and the Metasploitable 2 VM

## Important Notes
- Never expose the Metasploitable 2 VM to an untrusted network (use NAT or Host-only mode). In our case we created a LAN segment to connect our two VM's to each other.
- Make sure to add the default Kali user to the _gvm group or else your scans wont run properly (this has to do with _gvm having ownership over the files). This can be done with the following command:
  `sudo adduser kali _gvm`
