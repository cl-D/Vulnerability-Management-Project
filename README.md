# Vulnerability-Management-Project

## Introduction
In this project we aim to deploy a vulnerable machine using Metasploitable and VMWare Workstation, and then analyze it using OpenVAS, a vulnerability management tool. Metasploitable is an intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine, that is used as target practice for security training. It serves as a perfect playground for vulnerability management and analysis. In order to discover all of the vulnerabilities on the machine, we will use a tool called OpenVAS to perform scans on our system.
